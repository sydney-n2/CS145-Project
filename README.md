This repository contains the code to our final project of UCLA's CS145 course from spring quarter of 2024. 

The [WhoIsWho-IND-KDD-2024](https://www.biendata.xyz/competition/ind_kdd_2024/) challenge aims to address the name disambiguation problem that affects scientific literature. The goal is to create a model that is capable of accurately identifying incorrect paper assignments when given an author's profile as input. This project was an attempt at improving the baseline graph convolutional network (GCN) solution for this problem, but was not submitted officially to the competition. 

To replicate our environment, please download the folder which includes all files and the datasets [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fdrive%2Ffolders%2F1f1HjxLVVqhD47UwFa6Y6o9gIjSG26-3G%3Fusp%3Dsharing). Detailed instructions can be found in the Jupyter notebook titled "IND-WhoIsWho". 

The main driver of this project is the notebook file titled "IND-WhoIsWho".  The notebook file can be run to reproduce our results. The GCN Updated Model folder contains the code for the graph convolutional network model used in this project, including the baseline provided by the competition and the modified files from our team members.

This repository contains the code to our final project of UCLA's CS145 course from spring quarter of 2024. 

To replicate our environment, please download the folder which includes all files and the datasets [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fdrive%2Ffolders%2F1f1HjxLVVqhD47UwFa6Y6o9gIjSG26-3G%3Fusp%3Dsharing). Detailed instructions can be found in the Jupyter notebook titled "IND-WhoIsWho." The code created from our members will also be uploaded in this repository for easy, direct access.
